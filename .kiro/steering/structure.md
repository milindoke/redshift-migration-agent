## Architecture Patterns

- **Agent pattern**: Each agent is a Bedrock Agent (CfnAgent) with a system prompt constant in its Python module.
- **Knowledge Base pattern**: The Architecture Agent has a Bedrock Knowledge Base (S3 Vectors storage) attached at deploy time. CDK provisions the S3 Vector Bucket, Vector Index, KB, data source, and triggers `StartIngestionJob` via a custom resource — fully automated, no manual sync needed. Docs live in `knowledge_base/architecture/` and are uploaded to S3 by `BucketDeployment` on every `cdk deploy`.
- **Tool pattern**: Tools in `tools/redshift_tools.py` are plain Python functions that call AWS APIs via boto3 and return dicts. Errors return `{"error": ...}`, never raise. Lambda handlers dispatch to these functions based on `apiPath`.
- **Region resolution**: All tools use `_resolve_region()` — checks parameter first, then `AWS_REGION` env var, then falls back to `us-east-2`. No hardcoded regions.
- **Orchestrator** is a Bedrock Supervisor Agent that delegates to sub-agents via `AssociateAgentCollaborator`. It has `listRedshiftClusters` and cluster lock as direct action groups.
- **Memory**: All agents use `SESSION_SUMMARY` memory (30-day retention) with `cluster_id` as `memoryId` so conversation history persists per cluster across users and sessions.

## Conventions
- System prompts are module-level constants named `*_SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
- Every tool accepts `region` and `user_id` for cross-region support and identity propagation.
- Every tool emits audit events via `emit_audit_event(initiated_by=user_id)`.
- Environment config via `.env` files (see `.env.example`).
- CDK manages all infrastructure — no manual AWS console setup needed.
- To add new KB docs for the Architecture Agent: drop files into `knowledge_base/architecture/` and run `cdk deploy`. The ingestion job re-runs automatically.
