## 🎯 What It Does

This AI agent helps you migrate from AWS Redshift Provisioned clusters to Redshift Serverless by:

- ✅ Extracting all cluster configurations automatically
- ✅ Creating snapshots and restoring to Serverless
- ✅ Migrating IAM roles, VPC settings, and security groups
- ✅ Mapping parameter groups to Serverless equivalents
- ✅ Migrating scheduled queries from EventBridge to Serverless
- ✅ Carrying over maintenance track and cross-region snapshot copy settings
- ✅ Migrating usage limits with intelligent recommendations for Serverless
- ✅ Detecting multiple WLM queues and offering single or multi-workgroup migration
- ✅ **Persistent memory across hours/days** - Agent remembers your migrations
- ✅ Providing conversational guidance throughout the process

## 🤖 AI-Driven Scaling & Cost Optimization

The agent leverages the latest **AI-driven scaling features** of Amazon Redshift Serverless:

- **Price-Performance Targets**: Automatically configures workgroups with balanced (50) price-performance settings
- **Smart Cost Controls**: Sets MaxRPU limits automatically to prevent runaway costs
- **Intelligent Scaling**: Redshift AI continuously optimizes compute resources based on workload patterns
- **Zero Manual Tuning**: No need to manually adjust capacity - AI handles it for you

This means your migrated workloads get optimal performance at the lowest cost, automatically.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy (3 Minutes)

### One-Command Deploy

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/milindoke/redshift-migration-agent.git
cd redshift-migration-agent

# Deploy (that's it!)
./deploy
```

### Manual Deploy

```bash
# Using SAM CLI
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

See [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment/DEPLOY_NOW.md) for detailed instructions.

## 💬 How to Use

### Natural Conversation Interface (Recommended)

```bash
# Start chatting with the agent
./chat
```

Then just ask naturally:
```
You: List my Redshift clusters in us-east-2
Agent: [Shows clusters]

You: Tell me about the first one
Agent: [Shows details]

You: Migrate it to serverless
Agent: [Guides through migration]
```

See [Chat Guide](docs/guides/START_CHATTING.md) for more.

### Via AWS CLI

```bash
# Simple usage - memory enabled automatically
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name redshift-migration-agent \
  --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
  --payload '{"message":"List my Redshift clusters in us-east-2"}' \
  response.json

cat response.json

# Use with custom session_id for long-running migrations
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name redshift-migration-agent \
  --payload '{
    "message":"Start migration for prod-cluster",
    "session_id":"prod-migration-jan2024"
  }' \
  response.json

# Continue later - agent remembers everything from the same session
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name redshift-migration-agent \
  --payload '{
    "message":"What was the status?",
    "session_id":"prod-migration-jan2024"
  }' \
  response.json
```

Memory is enabled by default - the agent automatically remembers conversations within a session.

### 🧠 How Memory & Conversation Management Works

The agent uses two complementary systems to maintain context:

1. **Long-term Memory (AgentCore Memory)**
   - Stores summaries, facts, and preferences across sessions
   - Persists for hours/days - come back anytime with the same `session_id`
   - Automatically extracts key information from conversations
   - Enables the agent to remember migration progress and decisions

2. **Sliding Window (Recent Messages)**
   - Keeps the last 10 messages in active context
   - Prevents context overflow in tool-heavy conversations
   - Automatically truncates large tool results
   - Very conservative window size to maintain toolUse/toolResult balance

This dual approach means:
- ✅ Agent remembers important details across sessions
- ✅ Tool-heavy conversations work smoothly
- ✅ No manual intervention needed
- ✅ Context stays relevant and focused

**Note:** In extremely long conversations with many tool calls (30+ messages), you may need to start a new session. The chat script will automatically detect this and prompt you to start fresh. Don't worry - important information is preserved in long-term memory!

## 🎬 Example Conversations

```
You: "List all my Redshift clusters in us-east-2"
Agent: [Lists all clusters with details]

You: "Extract configuration from cluster prod-db-1"
Agent: [Extracts IAM roles, VPC, parameters, etc.]

You: "List scheduled queries for prod-db-1"
Agent: [Shows all EventBridge scheduled queries]

You: "Migrate cluster prod-db-1 to serverless with snapshot"
Agent: [Guides through migration process]

You: "Migrate scheduled queries from prod-db-1 to my-serverless-wg"
Agent: [Migrates all scheduled queries to serverless workgroup]

You: "Get snapshot copy settings for prod-db-1"
Agent: [Shows cross-region snapshot copy configuration]

You: "Configure snapshot copy for my-namespace to us-west-2 with 7 day retention"
Agent: [Configures cross-region snapshot copy for serverless]

You: "Get usage limits for prod-db-1"
Agent: [Shows usage limits configured on the cluster]

You: "Migrate usage limits from prod-db-1 to my-serverless-wg"
Agent: [Provides recommendations for serverless usage limits]

You: "Get WLM queues for prod-db-1"
Agent: [Shows WLM queue configuration]

You: "Create multiple workgroups from WLM queues for prod-db-1"
Agent: [Creates one workgroup per WLM queue for workload isolation]

You: "What's the status of my migration?"
Agent: [Checks and reports status]
```
